# Inventory Monitoring System with IoT Integration

## Description
Developed an inventory monitoring system using the ESP8266 microcontroller and ultrasonic sensors to track the quantity of two different products. Integrated the system with the Blynk app for real-time data visualization and alert notifications. Added functionality to control LEDs and a buzzer based on the product quantity to indicate low inventory levels.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Utilized ultrasonic sensors to measure the distance of products and determine their quantity.
- **Blynk Integration:** Employed the Blynk platform to visualize data remotely and receive real-time updates.
- **Alerts and Notifications:** Implemented LED indicators and a buzzer to alert when inventory levels fall below a specified threshold.
- **Cloud Connectivity:** Enabled data transmission and remote monitoring via Wi-Fi.

## Components
- **Microcontroller:** ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
- **Sensors:** Ultrasonic Distance Sensors (HC-SR04)
- **Communication:** Wi-Fi
- **Cloud Platform:** Blynk
- **Additional Components:** LEDs, Buzzer
- **Programming Language:** C/C++ (Arduino IDE)

## Functionality
- **Ultrasonic Distance Measurement:** Measures distance to determine the quantity of products in stock.
- **Data Transmission:** Sends product quantity data to the Blynk app using virtual pins.
- **LED and Buzzer Alerts:** Activates LEDs and buzzer when product quantities fall below or equal to 2.

## Achievements
- **Real-Time Data Visualization:** Successfully integrated real-time data visualization and alerts using Blynk.
- **Effective Alert System:** Implemented a user-friendly alert system with LEDs and a buzzer to ensure prompt action on low inventory.
- **IoT Technologies:** Demonstrated effective use of IoT technologies for remote monitoring and control.
